## Introduction

The Course Management System (CMS) is a C++ application designed as a Data Structures and Algorithms assignment. It demonstrates the usage of various data structures and algorithms to manage and manipulate course-related information efficiently.

## Features

- **Data Structures Usage**: Utilizes various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees) to organize and manage course data.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Implements algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) to enhance the functionality of the system.
- **User Interaction**: Provides an interactive interface for users to access and manage course information.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling mechanisms for a more robust and reliable application.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any C++ IDE)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/11a55an/course-management-system.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.

3. Compile the C++ code.

4. Run the executable generated after compilation.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the Course Management System.
